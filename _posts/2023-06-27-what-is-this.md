Another day another dollar?  Well not really but hopefully soon enough that will be the case.

Work has been such a madhouse I haven't even had time to look at this or think about this nearly as much as I wish I could.  Along with that our family will have some major changes that have put some breaks on projects and what I am learning.

# Life update

In the next year, my wife and I have made the choice to move to Las Vegas/Henderson area of Nevada.  The major reason for this deals with health of the family.  For this I am hoping to find a full time job that is either in Las Vegas that is hybrid or remote full time.  I've also started to work on the process of selling off all the older/things I don't use for tech in the house.


# Tech update

With the release of Proxmox 8 I have installed that onto my server box.  Have enjoyed it as much as I've used it lately.  Along with this I have switched my desktop with the 2U chassis to the 4U server chassis. I have noticed a huge change in temps for the process which has been wonderful for my sanity of the fans.  My other major thing I'm trying to do is clean up the tech I own.  I've started to begin to ebay a bunch of different items to try and get some extra funds.  This also just gets rid of misc old stuff I don't touch including a voodoo 2 PCI card, and other items like that.

# Learning

I've been learning or at least trying to learn some front end.  Mainly some react/nextjs style stuff which not a huge fan of, but that's partly due to I'm so new at it and needing to figure what to do.  My first thing I have started to work on deals with nextjs and firebase making a reddit clone.  I haven't had nearly enough time lately but really enjoyed making it so far. 


Short post but yeah it what have time for.  Might try and make some shorter posts like this and see how it goes to get myself to make some content.
