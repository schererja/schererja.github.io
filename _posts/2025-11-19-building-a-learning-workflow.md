title: "Building My Learning Workflow: A Structured Approach to Leveling Up"

Over the past several months, I’ve been focusing on rebuilding and sharpening my full-stack development skills in a more systematic way. As someone who has spent over a decade working across both software and hardware engineering—with my current role centered around hardware test automation—I wanted a workflow that reflects how I actually learn, build, and iterate.

This post explains **why I created a new learning workflow**, **how I’m structuring the projects**, and **what my goals are moving forward**.

## Why I Built a Learning Workflow

I didn’t want tutorials or copy-paste examples. I wanted a process where I could:

- **Learn step by step**
- **Build real things**
- **Submit work, get feedback, and improve**
- **Develop production-grade habits**
- **Keep everything consistent and versioned**

This led to what I’m calling my **Learning Projects Workflow** — a structured, iterative process focused on practical mastery rather than passive learning.

## How the Workflow Is Structured

Instead of random experiments, I’m organizing everything into a repeatable model:

### **1. Daily/Session-Based Progress (`day-1`, `day-2`, etc.)**

Each day or session is its own folder.
This helps me track what I learned, what I built, and how the project evolves.

### **2. Real Tasks, Not Tutorials**

Every session includes small, realistic tasks:

- Build a page or component
- Refactor something
- Add a feature
- Integrate a service
- Solve a design or architecture problem

This forces me to think like an engineer, not a student.

### **3. Submit → Feedback → Iterate**

After each session, I submit my work for review.
This gives me:

- Immediate corrections
- Better patterns
- Cleaner code
- Professional-level habits

It mirrors a real engineering workflow — design, build, review, iterate.

### **4. Focused Technical Areas**

Right now, I’m deepening my skills in front-end engineering using:

- **React**
- **Next.js (coming soon)**
- **Modern component patterns**
- **State management**
- **API integration**
- **Clean project structure**

This will later expand into backend services, DevOps, and full-stack architecture.

## Why React / Next.js?

I specifically chose these because they reflect what most modern companies use, especially for:

- Scalable product frontends
- Internal dashboards
- High-performance UI systems
- Developer-friendly workflows

React gives me foundational knowledge, while Next.js provides a full application framework for real-world deployment scenarios.

## A Bit About My Background

I currently work as a **Senior Hardware Test Engineer at Las Vegas Sands Corp.**, building automated testing systems for gaming hardware and software. My day-to-day involves:

- QA automation
- GRPC services
- Embedded systems workflows (Yocto, Bitbake)
- Golang development
- Python tooling
- Ensuring reliability and reproducibility at scale

Before that, I spent years working across both software and hardware engineering roles, always with a focus on building **robust, maintainable, production-grade systems**.

This learning project is my way of sharpening the software side even further using a structured, disciplined approach.

## What’s Next

Over time, this workflow will cover:

- Building a full portfolio site
- Creating API-driven components
- Deploying a complete Next.js application
- Expanding into backend and cloud services
- Building tools that integrate hardware + software expertise

I’ll continue posting updates here so prospective employers — or anyone following along — can see how I grow, learn, and build.

If you’re reading this as someone evaluating my work:
**This workflow reflects exactly how I learn, how I think, and how I approach engineering problems.**

It's iterative, deliberate, and focused on producing real results.
