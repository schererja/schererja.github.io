I have officially begun my journey to begin a new development job.  I will be at my current company 13 years this September, the time to move on is soon.  There many reasons for this and in the end it will be the best for the family.  The process has not been an easy one so far.

# Job search

So far this has been one up hill battle.  Trying to find a remote position in the world of development is not easy right now.  I have had multiple positions applying for that have shown that up to 800 people have applied for them.  This is for sure something that has drained on me when I know that I can do most of the work that would be asked of me in the end.  I have applied for many jobs that I have felt I have close to the amount of requirements, or more than the requirements, and end up hearing nothing back or denied.

# Ghosting of people

I am honestly shocked how much ghosting happens in the world of trying to find a job in general.  It seems to be way more common than I expected it to be in the end.  I've had jobs that I applied for in the last month and there has been nothing at all, not even something on the job site showing they aren't accepting anymore.  I just don't get why that is something that companies find to be a great idea.

# Life

I've been in the process of trying to get a bunch of my old stuff sold along with older computer parts and many other things.  This is going to be super important in the end to be able to have extra money to pay things down, along with the ability to just have less stuff to move in the end.  Right now I feel like we have way too much stuff, mixture of important items, and just old stuff that we don't really need anymore.
