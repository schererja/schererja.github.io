I've recently been thinking a lot of what I want to do this next year.  I think this is a good time to start working on this and getting it into writing.

# Updates

Life has been super busy lately and haven't even had time to work on much of my own projects.  Between work, life, and everything, I've been so busy that I
can barely focus on getting any time to work on any of that. Work has been doing the end of year push, the wife has been super busy with her current work, and
the family along with the house is typically my focus on other days.

# Goals

I've been thinking a lot of what I want to do for goals for this next year.  Some are personal, some are work related, some are life in general related, and some are hopefully programming related.  I think I will categorize these into the three sections.  So lets go ahead and start this

## Personal
1. Focus on keeping things under control with my mental health.
2. Focus on keeping myself organized with respect to bills and paperwork.
3. Focus on implementing a way to communicate with other people efficiently and effectively.

## Work
1. Focus on implementing a way to communicate with other people efficiently and effectively.
2. Focus on major projects that are already in progress and ones that are delayed.
3. Focus on organizing tasks with respect to their progress and priority.

## Life
1. Focus on family members and making sure everyone is happy.
2. Focus on projects around the house that sometimes get left behind.
3. Focus on mental health of everyone in the family.

## Business?
1. Focus on an initial website that can be used to show off projects
2. Creation of the first project for the company.
3. Focus on learning about projects that can be useful for small businesses.


While these goals maybe a bit unrealistic in the end, they are goals I want to try and focus on.  Even if half are done well, half is better than nothing.

# Future

Recently I did the process of trying to figure out what I'd like as a name for a business/company of sorts.  It started out as being Honey Creek Consulting, then went to Intrik8 Consulting, to the current thought of being Intrik8 Labs.  This has been a mixture of names that have gone back and forth that my Wife thought of and I have thought of to use as a mixture of consulting and products.  I'm hoping this next year to begin the process of building that first app, along with learning the ins and outs of the initial process of a business.

I also hope that in the end I may get the confidence to do some streaming of the process on YouTube or Twitch.  Unknown which I feel more comfortable with.  There will be a lot of learning, and self advancement in the next year is the majority of that goal.
